# Java Webapp Tuturial

Not for public consumption really -- this is just me trying to understand how
developing web application in Java might work.

### Tools

1. [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) -- to build things
1. [Apachy Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) -- to manage dependencies, this
should already be installed in your `ANTLIB` directory.
1. A running instance of [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) to which the
webapp will be deployed.

### Why?

Because I'm not an IDE guy, I wanted to figure out how to use a set of
appropriate tools to create java webapps using the CLI and my favorite text
editor.
